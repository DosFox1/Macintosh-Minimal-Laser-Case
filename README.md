# Macintosh-Minimal-Laser-Case

A minimal case for a Macintosh 128/512/Plus logic board, constructed from 5mm laser cut material.

**Features**

This .SVG file is intended to be just large enough to accomodate an appropriate Macintosh logic board (128/512/Plus),
as well as my Pico Analogue Board:

There is also a cut out for a speaker, as well as space on the right hand wall for an appropriate battery case to power the RTC. 
It is anticipated that the logic board and the analogue board are raised by M3 10mm spacers. 
M3 10mm screws can then be used on both sides to fix the boards in place, and the speaker can be glued into position. 

Included are two "plungers" for the reset and programmer switch. They can either be inserted loose into the case, or adhered directly to the buttons. 
It is advised to use a mild adhesive - such as double sided foam tape - as opposed to superglue.

**Important Note**

Due to the dimensions of the case, it is advised that the case is assembled around the logic board. 
Please note that if the logic board is needed to be removed, it may be benefical to only friction fit the top and angled front panel in position. 
If those panels are glued in place, it will prove to be challenging to remove. 
This case has also been designed for the Plus reloaded project (https://github.com/max234252/MacPlus-Reloaded)
As such, it may be necessary for the rear metal bracket to be removed from the board.

This design has been intended to be used for the 128/512/Plus, but it may fit a Macintosh SE or SE/30 logic board.

The .SVG file will need to be converted to an appropriate file for your laser cutter.
